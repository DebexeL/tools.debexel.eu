# tools.debexel.eu

This is the current source for my tools page (tools.debexel.eu).
The idea for these "tools" is to provide an easy "portal" for me and possibly others using poor-quality connections to access e-shopping sites.
You know, first open the web shop page, wait for it to completely load every javascript, css, etc.. ONLY so You can access the search bar, after which you have to wait again for the site to load all the search results.
